# hello-world
This repository is for practicing GitHub Flow.
I was intructed to write about myself, so here it goes..
Hi! My name is Hamsini, it means Swan. (Pretty cool, huh?)
I am 20 years old, (turning 21 in July) and I looovee cheese!
I think a lot, not always a good thing but I like that about myself nonetheless, although it causes frequent brain cramps.
I also read a lot and love magic! (I think it is real! Shhh!)
That's enough about me, tell me  about you, I am curious!


This is the second try, if you see this, it means I am trying to do this shit without the help of the tutorial.
